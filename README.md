# Gravity-Accelerator
This project implements a gravity accelerator using Verilog and Vivado. It simulates the physics of gravitational acceleration, calculating velocity and position over time within a digital circuit environment. The project includes testbenches and waveform analysis to ensure accurate simulation and performance.
